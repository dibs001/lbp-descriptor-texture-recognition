#   Preprocessing Image - before LBP Feature Extraction
#   Why?
#   The first step is to preprocess the image to remove any noise present in it. 
#   This can be done using a denoising filterS, such as the Gaussian filter or the median filter. 
#   The denoising filter removes any and all noise, while preserving the texture information.
#   This enhances the discriminative power of the LBP descriptor, 
#   and facilitates the Texture Recognition process.
#   We are using the median filter in this scenario. Usage can vary depending on the type of image!

import cv2
from skimage.feature import local_binary_pattern
import numpy as np


img = cv2.imread('assets/images/image_1.jpeg')      # Read Image from source; can also be a url

#   Usage of OpenCV (cv2) Python libraries simplifies 
#   image preprocessing due to presence of 
#   built-in functions like cvtColor, medianBlur, GaussianBlur, etc.


gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)        # Above method 'cvtColor' is used to convert the given original image into grayscale for further denoising

blurred = cv2.medianBlur(gray, 5)                  # Usage of 'medianBlur' filter for denoising


#   LBP Features Extraction 
#   After preprocessing the image, the next step is to extract the LBP features. 
#   LBP features is being extracted by 
#       1. Comparing the intensity of each pixel with its neighboring pixels, and 
#       2. Encoding the result as a 'binary pattern'.
#   This process is repeated for each pixel in the image, 
#   and the resulting patterns are used for classification tasks (SVMs, etc).

lbp = local_binary_pattern(blurred, 8, 1)


lbp = np.uint8((lbp / np.max(lbp)) * 255)           # Converting LBP to 'uint8' and normalizing the values to fall in (0 - 255) range

cv2.imshow('Original', gray)                        # Image Display ORIGINAL
cv2.imshow('Blurred', blurred)                    # Image Display DENOISED
cv2.imshow('LBP', lbp)                              # Image Display LBP Feature Extracted
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
